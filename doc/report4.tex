\section{Problem Description}

In this report, we will test the execution time, error of eigen values, and error of eigen vectors
solved by power method and inverse power method.
The random matrices for testing will be symmetric diagonally dominated, defined as
$$
A = \frac{1}{2}I + B + B^{T}
$$
where $B$ is a random $50 \times 50$ matrix with entries drawn from the normal distribution.

Let $\lambda^*$ denote the largest/smallest eigen value solved by numpy as the ``ground truth'',
we measure the error of our eigen value as $\abs{\lambda - \lambda^*}$
and the error of our eigen vector as
$$
\frac{\norm{Ax - \lambda x}_{\infty}}{\lambda^*}.
$$
We will repeat each experiment 25 times and tke the average of the errors.
For each method, we will set threshold as $10 \times 10^{-4}$.

\section{Results}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}

	\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
		\toprule
		{} &  $\lambda$ time &  $\lambda$ error &  Vector Error \\
		\midrule
		Smallest Eig &     0.009330 &      0.000003 &      0.000067 \\
		Largest Eig  &     0.009005 &      0.000636 &      0.036263 \\
		\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
	\caption{Comparison table for results of power method and inverse power method}
\end{center}
\end{table}

From the table, we can see that both method (smallest by inverse power method and largest by power method)
uses similar amount of time.
The error of both eigen value and eigen vector produced by inverse power method is smaller than power method.
