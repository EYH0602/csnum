\section{Problem Description}
In this coding report,
we explore the implementation and performance of gaussian elimination and LU factorization.
We first demonstrate the methods by solving linear systems from homework 2
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	2 & 4 & 5 \\
	7 & 6 & 5 \\
	9 & 11 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	3 \\
	2 \\
	1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Then we compare two methods:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item gaussian elimination solve with back substitution (GE)
	\item LU factorization then solve with forward and back substitution (LU)
\end{enumerate}
on size $n = 50, 100, 250, 500$ matrices.
The linear system $Ax = b$ to solve will have the following setup
$$
A = 5\times I + R
$$
where random entries $r_{ij}, b_{ij} \sim N(0, 1)$.
We record the errors of two methods in a table and then plot their execution time v.s. $n$.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Homework Problem}
By using LU factorization method on $A$, we get
$$
L = \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 \\
	3.5 & 1 & 0 \\
	4.5 & 0.875 & 1 
\end{bmatrix} \\
U = \begin{bmatrix}
	2 & 4 & 5 \\
	0 & -8 & -12.5 \\
	0 & 0 & -8.5625
\end{bmatrix}
$$
which are the same as the results from homework.

By calling `gauss\_solve' and `lu\_solve',
both methods get the same result for 8 digits
$$
x = \begin{bmatrix}
	-0.25547445  \\
	0.13868613  \\
	0.59124088
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

\subsection{Comparison}
To make the comparison fairer,
for each $n$ we call `gauss\_solve' and `lu\_solve' $10$ times
and record the average error and execution time.
Since LU provides the option to solve with same $A$ matrix and different $b$,
we also record the time for using the different and same $A$ matrix on two methods.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{rrr}
	\toprule
	{ } &           GE &           LU \\
	\midrule
	 50 & 1.549863e-11 & 9.336112e-12 \\
	100 & 1.532049e-11 & 1.424910e-11 \\
	250 & 8.491823e-11 & 9.370805e-11 \\
	500 & 9.946900e-10 & 1.124538e-09 \\
	\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Errors of $\| Ax - b\|_{2}$ for GE and LU methods}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\begin{figure}[H]

	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}

	    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/report2_cell_12_output_1.png}
	    \label{fig:0}

	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}

	     \label{fig:1}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Execution time of GE and LU with different (left) and same (right) $A$.}
\end{figure}


From the table, we cen see that then $n$ is small, i.e. $n = 50, 100$,
LU results have smaller error than GE results.
When $n$ gets larger to $250, 500$,
LU lose some accuracy, but GE's error is relatively stable.
However, there is no clear evidence to determine the difference in errors for two methods.
From the above  graph, we can see that for different $A$ matrix every time,
LU and GE has roughly the same execution time.
When the size of the matrix goes up, LU solves the linear system a litter faster than GE.
If we use the same $A$ matrix for the $10$ repetition and only solve with different $b$,
we can see that LU is much faster than GE
since it only do gaussian elimination the first time and the rest is just forward and backward substitution.

\subsection{Experiments on matrix family $\hat{A} = R$}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{center}	
	\begin{tabular}{rrr}
	\toprule
	{ } &           GE &           LU \\
	\midrule
	 50 & 2.427530e-12 & 3.156321e-12 \\
	100 & 4.067419e-11 & 4.183250e-11 \\
	250 & 2.874165e-10 & 3.586288e-10 \\
	500 & 3.865731e-08 & 1.125961e-08 \\
	\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Errors of $\| \hat{A}x - b\|_{2}$ for GE and LU methods}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
	    \centering
	    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/report2_cell_12_output_1.png}
	    \label{fig:2}
	\end{subfigure}
	\hfill
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
	    \centering
	     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/report2_cell_15_output_1.png}
	     \label{fig:3}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Execution time of GE and LU with different (left) and same (right) $\hat{A}$.}
\end{figure}

In this case, we still cannot detect any clear trend in errors.
In terms of execution time,
solving $\hat{A}$ shows similar trends as solving $A$.
